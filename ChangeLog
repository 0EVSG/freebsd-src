	* include/sys/kmem.h : Make sure that when calling __vmem_alloc
	that we do not have __GFP_ZERO set.  Once the memory is allocated
	then zero out the memory if __GFP_ZERO is passed to
	__vmem_alloc.

	* modules/spl/spl-kmem.c : Make sure to disable interrupts
	when necessary to avoid deadlocks.  We were seeing the deadlock
	when calling kmem_cache_generic_constructor() and then an interrupt
	forced us to end up calling kmem_cache_generic_destructor()
	which caused our deadlock.

	: Initial commit of the solaris porting layer (spl).  Included
	in addition to the source is an initial autoconf / configure
	style build system.
