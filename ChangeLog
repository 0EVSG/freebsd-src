	* configure.ac, autoconf/* : Initial pass at resolving
	API changes introduced by kernels newer than 2.6.18.

2008-05-21 Brian Behlendorf <behlendorf1@llnl.gov>

	* : Tag spl-0.3.1

	* : License headers including URCL added for release.

2008-05-21 Brian Behlendorf <behlendorf1@llnl.gov>

	* : Tag spl-0.3.0

	* configure.ac: Improved autotools support.

2008-04-26 Brian Behlendorf <behlendorf1@llnl.gov>

	* include/sys/mutex.h : Implemented a close approximation
	of adaptive mutexes.  These changes however required me to 
	export a new symbol from the kernel proper 'task_curr()'
	which means we are now dependant on a patched kernel.

2008-04-24 Brian Behlendorf <behlendorf1@llnl.gov>

	* : Tag spl-0.2.1 

	* modules/spl/spl-proc.c : Add /proc/sys/spl/version.

2008-04-24 Herb Wartens <wartens2@llnl.gov>

	* include/sys/kmem.h : Make sure that when calling __vmem_alloc
	that we do not have __GFP_ZERO set.  Once the memory is allocated
	then zero out the memory if __GFP_ZERO is passed to
	__vmem_alloc.

2008-04-16 Herb Wartens <wartens2@llnl.gov>

	* modules/spl/spl-kmem.c : Make sure to disable interrupts
	when necessary to avoid deadlocks.  We were seeing the deadlock
	when calling kmem_cache_generic_constructor() and then an interrupt
	forced us to end up calling kmem_cache_generic_destructor()
	which caused our deadlock.

2008-02-26 Brian Behlendorf <behlendorf1@llnl.gov>

	: Initial commit of the solaris porting layer (spl).  Included
	in addition to the source is an initial autoconf / configure
	style build system.
