	* modules/spl/spl-kmem.c : Make sure to disable interrupts
	when necessary to avoid deadlocks.  We were seeing the deadlock
	when calling kmem_cache_generic_constructor() and then an interrupt
	forced us to end up calling kmem_cache_generic_destructor()
	which caused our deadlock.

	: Initial commit of the solaris porting layer (spl).  Included
	in addition to the source is an initial autoconf / configure
	style build system.
