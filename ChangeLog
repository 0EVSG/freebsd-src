	* : Tag spl-0.3.3

	* : modules/sys/kmem-slab.c : Refined SPL slab to include
	per-cpu caches, removed internal hash, other general 
	performance improvements.  Much work remain but it's pretty
	good for an initial implementation.

	* : modules/sys/kmem-slab.c : Re-implemented the slab to no
	longer be based on the linux slab but to be it's own complete
	implementation.  The new slab behaves much more like the
	Solaris slab than the Linux slab.

	* : Tag spl-0.3.2

	* : Extensive improvements to the build system to detect kernel
	API changes so we can flexibly build with a wider range of kernel
	versions.  The code has now been testing with the 2.6.18-32chaos
	and 2.6.25.3-18.fc9 kernels, however we should also be compatible
	with other kernels in the range of 2.6.18-2.6.25.

2008-05-25 Brian Behlendorf <behlendorf1@llnl.gov>

	* configure.ac, autoconf/* : Initial pass at resolving
	API changes introduced by kernels newer than 2.6.18.

	* : Tag spl-0.3.1

	* : License headers including URCL added for release.

2008-05-21 Brian Behlendorf <behlendorf1@llnl.gov>

	* : Tag spl-0.3.0

	* configure.ac: Improved autotools support.

2008-04-26 Brian Behlendorf <behlendorf1@llnl.gov>

	* include/sys/mutex.h : Implemented a close approximation
	of adaptive mutexes.  These changes however required me to 
	export a new symbol from the kernel proper 'task_curr()'
	which means we are now dependant on a patched kernel.

2008-04-24 Brian Behlendorf <behlendorf1@llnl.gov>

	* : Tag spl-0.2.1 

	* modules/spl/spl-proc.c : Add /proc/sys/spl/version.

2008-04-24 Herb Wartens <wartens2@llnl.gov>

	* include/sys/kmem.h : Make sure that when calling __vmem_alloc
	that we do not have __GFP_ZERO set.  Once the memory is allocated
	then zero out the memory if __GFP_ZERO is passed to
	__vmem_alloc.

2008-04-16 Herb Wartens <wartens2@llnl.gov>

	* modules/spl/spl-kmem.c : Make sure to disable interrupts
	when necessary to avoid deadlocks.  We were seeing the deadlock
	when calling kmem_cache_generic_constructor() and then an interrupt
	forced us to end up calling kmem_cache_generic_destructor()
	which caused our deadlock.

2008-02-26 Brian Behlendorf <behlendorf1@llnl.gov>

	: Initial commit of the solaris porting layer (spl).  Included
	in addition to the source is an initial autoconf / configure
	style build system.
