* We may need a libefi replacement.  It appears libefi is used
  to determine if the device passed to zpool is a 'whole device'
  or just a partition of a device.  In the short term I think we
  can simply treat everything as a partition and be alright.

* We also do not have support for getting Solaris style device
  ids which is done when a zpool is setup.  We may or may not
  be able to live without this, the jury is still out.

* Port zvol (ZFS volume interface).

* Port zpl (ZFS posix interface).

* Port lustre fsfilt interface to use DMU.

* Andreas issue #1:
  "the maximum allocation DMU "blocksize" was 128kB and it would be better
  to be able to get 1MB contiguous allocations for best performance"

* Andreas issue #2:
  "there would need to be some work done to allow multiple operations to
  be atomic.  This is needed by Lustre for object creation + LAST_ID
  updates, unlink + llog updates, etc.  Conceptually this isn't very
  much work for a phase tree, but I've never looked at the ZFS code."

* Design and implement mechanism for viewing and modifying OST content
  from user space (by manipulating datasets/objects), possibly
  by implementing scaled down file system interface.
